# [JSF04] Project: Portfolio Piece

## Project Overview

- The Portfolio Piece project is a culmination of my learning journey in Vue.js, showcasing my ability to design and develop a comprehensive e-commerce application. This project demonstrates my understanding of modern web development principles, including responsive design, state management, and user authentication. The application is built using Vue.js, Vue Router, Tailwind CSS, and Pinia, and features a range of products, categories, and reviews.


## Project Brief

1. Clone your JSF03 challenge and create a new repository, remember the naming convention: JSF-Portfolio_Piece_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSF04

2. Fix any issues you had in JSF03.

3. Study and understand the extended user stories for the Portfolio Piece given on your dashboard rubric. The main user stories and presentation count for 119 points (85%)

4. Choose stretch goal/s that make up at least 21 points (15%), you are allowed to attempt more user stories but note that your final mark will be capped at 120% if you successfully complete user stories beyond the requirement.

5. Code your solution in Vue.js and document your code with JSDoc.

6. Commit changes to your GitHub repository.

7. Deploy your application in Vercel.

8. Use Zoom to record a 10 minutes video explaining the project and the code.

9. Upload the video recording to your YouTube channel.

10. Add a README.md file with the project description, how to set up the project, technologies used, link to your hosted application, link to your YouTube video

11. Test your application for any bugs and improvements.

12. Verify that your changes have been successfully pushed to your remote Github repository.

13. Submit your Github repository link on JSF04 project tab.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js: A progressive and flexible JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- Vue Router: The official router for Vue.js, providing a robust and flexible way to manage client-side routing.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling and customization of web applications.
- Pinia: A lightweight and intuitive state management library for Vue.js.
- Vercel: A platform for deploying and hosting web applications.

## Usage Examples

- Product Browsing: Browse through a wide range of products, with filtering and sorting options.
- Product Details: View detailed product information, including price, description, and reviews.
- User Authentication: Log in and log out of the application, with authentication handled by Pinia.
- Cart Management: Add products to your cart, view cart contents, and checkout.
- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- Wishlist: Add products to your wishlist for later.
- Error Handling: The application includes error handling for API requests, ensuring that users are notified of any errors that occur.


## Set Up Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run npm install to install all dependencies.
3. Run npm run dev to start the project in development mode.
4. Open your web browser and navigate to the localhost link to access the e-commerce store.


## Reflections

### Areas of Mastery

- I successfully implemented Vue.js and Vue Router to create a robust and maintainable application. I demonstrated a strong understanding of Tailwind CSS, using it to create a visually appealing and consistent design. I also successfully integrated the Fake Store API, using it to fetch e-commerce data and populate the application.

### Challenges Faced

- One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes. I had to use a combination of CSS media queries and Vue.js's built-in responsive design features to achieve this.

- Another challenge I faced was managing state and handling user authentication using Pinia. I had to carefully plan and implement the state management system to ensure that it was efficient and scalable.

- Optimizing the application's performance and ensuring fast loading times was also a challenge. I had to use various optimization techniques, such as code splitting and lazy loading, to achieve this.

- Debugging and troubleshooting issues with the application was also a challenge. I had to use various debugging tools, such as the Vue.js Devtools and the browser's developer console, to identify and fix issues.

### Areas of Improvement

- One area of improvement is to improve the application's accessibility, ensuring that it is usable by users with disabilities. I plan to add more accessibility features, such as screen reader support and keyboard navigation, to achieve this.

- Another area of improvement is to add more features and functionality to the application, such as user profiles and order tracking. I plan to add these features in future updates to the application.

- Improving the application's security is also an area of improvement. I plan to add more security features, such as encryption and secure authentication, to ensure that user data is protected and secure.

- Refactoring the codebase to improve maintainability and readability is also an area of improvement. I plan to refactor the code to make it more modular and reusable, and to add more comments and documentation to make it easier to understand.

### Lessons Learned

- Throughout this project, I learned the importance of careful planning and design. I had to carefully plan and design the application's architecture and user interface to ensure that it was scalable and maintainable.
